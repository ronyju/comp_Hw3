# Comp Hw5:

***test we need to debug:***
bool foo(){
        return true and true;
}

void main(){
        if (foo()){ print("foo is true");}
        else {print("foo is false");}
}

**what's left:**
1. IF that has an open statement.
2. While that has an open statement.
5. Override
6. Fix the bug - (the test above)

make sure you changed - EmitBoolAssign
