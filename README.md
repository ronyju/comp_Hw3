# Comp Hw5:

***test we need to debug:***
bool foo(){
        return true;
}

void main() {
        while (foo()){
                print("foo is true");
                break;
        }
}

**what's left:**
1. IF that has an open statement.
2. While that has an open statement.
5. Override
6. Fix the bug - how to handle (bool a = true;)

make sure you changed - EmitBoolAssign
