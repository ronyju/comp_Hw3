Changes 31.5.2023:
this are the things I added and tested:
from the instructions : I did 
5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 16 + 17 (also in the whatsapp group).


other than that:
I made sure the override function calling and creating workes and throu the right error.
It required a few changes you can see them in the github diff but I dont think you need to get into it really.

I checked there is a main and that its not override.

What's left:
handaling the if, else, while scopes.
notice that they wrote something a little wired about how many scopes an if gets, 
I wasnt sure whats the best way to approch it there for I havnt started working in this erea. 
you will also need to check that the break and conitue are inside While scope -> you may use this function that I wrote (return yes if the top scope is WHILE_SCOPE):
bool IsCurrentScopeWhile();

you will also need to add the logic to check errorAmbiguousCall. they added an extra explining about it - if I will manage to do it today I will as it is very deep in my code . will remove it if so.

you will need to check that byte is not bigger than 255.
thay havnt yet answered me in the piatzza
