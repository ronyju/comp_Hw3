# comp_Hw3
Changes 31.5.2023:
this are the things I added and tested:
from the instructions : I did 
5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 16 + 17 (also in the whatsapp group).


other than that:
I made sure the override function calling and creating workes and throu the right error.
It required a few changes you can see them in the github diff but I dont think you need to get into it really.

I think that what you have left is handaling the if, else, while scopes.
notice that they wrote something a little compusing about how mant scopes an if gets, 
I wasnt sure whats the best way to approch it there for I havnt started woriking in this erea. 
you will also need to check that the break and conitue are inside While scope = use this function that I created (return yes if the top scope is WHILE_SCOPE):
bool IsCurrentScopeWhile();
